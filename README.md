Data Analysis - WeatherPy

_Max Temperature in Northern/Southern Hemisphere Latitudes_
  Both hemispheres present an inverse relationship between latitude and temperature - as latitude decreases, temperature increases. However, the northern hemisphere   has a 33% stronger correlation of this than the southern hemisphere.
  
_Cloudiness in Northern/Southern Hemisphere Latitudes__
  When viewing the initial latitude vs cloudiness plot, there does not seem to be a correlation between the two values. However, when the data is analyzed in         accordance to hemispheres, a **slight** correlation is shown. As latitude increases (northern hemisphere), cloudiness increases. As latitdue decreases (southern     hemisphere), cloudiness decreases.
  
_Wind Speed in Northern/Southern Hemisphere Latitudes_
  While both plots present relatively weak correlations, wind speeds increase as latitudes approach both poles.
